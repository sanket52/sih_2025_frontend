              The Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is envisioned to promote
              innovation and out-of-the-box thinking among young minds and aims
              to institutionalize a model for harnessing the creativity and
              technical expertise of millions of Indian students for the direct
              benefit of our nation. Through the Smart India Hackathon 2025
              (SIH2025), the Ministry of Education’s Innovation Cell (MIC) tried
              to crowdsource solutions for improving governance and quality of
              life and provide young citizens with an opportunity to co-create
              and present innovative solutions to India's pressing needs.
              <br /> <br />
              Post SIH, the Ministry of Education is committed to the further
              development, implementation, and deployment of SIH-winning ideas
              by effectively supporting the concerned ministries/departments.
              Hence, to initiate the development and deployment of SIH-winning
              ideas, the concerned Ministry/ Departments (Problem Statement
              given agency) is requested to follow the guidelines indicated
              below.
            </p>

            <ol style={{ marginLeft: "-15px" }}>
              <li>
                Hackathons are opportunities to quickly check the feasibility of
                any novel idea, hence projects developed during Hackathons are
                usually very crude and absolutely not ready for field
                implementation or deployment as working solutions. They require
                considerable work or development before
                implementation/deployment as reliable, dependable solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ideally, the duration for development and implementation of SIH
                winning project should be between 6 months to 1 year. However,
                the duration could be increased/decreased with the mutual
                consent of all the involved parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Once the Ministry of Education/AICTE shared the contact details
                of the winning teams with the respective ministry/department,
                they are requested to directly initiate communication with the
                winning teams to discuss further development and implementation
                roadmap of the winning ideas.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Ministry/Department should request a detailed project plan from
                the winning team which should include implementation details,
                tools (software & hardware) required, expert support required
                along with timelines.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Ministry should procure commercial software/ hardware critical
                for the development and implementation of the winning project.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                7 Minimum one experienced technical expert per idea/winning
                solution should be assigned as a ‘mentor’ to ensure timely
                progress and implementation of the project.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                In the majority of cases, the winning team will work remotely
                from their college, hence effective coordination is very
                critical. It is highly recommended that the ministry/department
                schedule regular weekly/monthly monitoring sessions with each
                team through available video conferencing tools.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                If required, an appropriate faculty member from the same
                institution of the winning team may be co-opted as an additional
                ‘mentor’ for better coordination on project development.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Additionally, written consent from the winning team’s
                educational institution should be taken committing support
                (permissions and time commitments) during the development and
                deployment of the project. Educational institutions will not
                have any financial burden in this regard.{" "}

              <li>
                {" "}
                The selected teams may be asked to visit the ministry/deployment
                site when required for project-related work. In such cases,
                expenses related to travel, stay and other logistic support need
                to be borne by the concerned department/ministry as per usual
                government norms.{" "}

              <li>
                {" "}
                In the case of software solutions, a cybersecurity expert may be
                engaged to ensure that the development of the winning solution
                is on par with the required safety standards.{" "}

              <li>
                {" "}
                In the case of a hardware-based product, then it is highly
                recommended that a ‘Product Design Expert’ may be regularly
                consulted to ensure state of an art product.{" "}

              <li>
                {" "}
                Stipend: It is highly recommended that the department/ministry
                provide a monthly stipend and/or internship to all members of
                teams working on the development and implementation of winning
                projects. Each team member can be given a consolidated stipend
                of Rs 5,000/- per month for a period of 6 months (minimum) or as
                per the Ministry/Department norms.{" "}

                Note: A maximum of 6 students will get the above-mentioned
                stipend. If a team has more students (we have given each team a
                provision to add one more team member), then the stipend per
                student will be reduced to accommodate extra members.

                Ministry/Department will share quarterly status reports
                regarding the implementation and development of SIH-winning
                solutions with the Ministry of Education’s Innovation cell and
                AICTE.

              The Intellectual Property (IP) of the solution resides with the
              students who have developed and deployed the solution
              post-Hackathon but the concerned ministry will have lifetime
              access to the solution for free. This has been done to encourage
              Startups to be created out of the developed solutions while also
              keeping in mind the interest of the involved ministries.

                In case the solution developed by the teams is an assembly of
                available components, then any conflict arising due to
                plagiarism, IP, or copyright violations, the individuals of the
                concerned team will be solely responsible. Hence, the teams have
                been advised to use verified open-source components only and
                acknowledge them appropriately. Ministry/department may also get
                a signed declaration from all the members of the team in this
                regard to indemnify itself from any legal conflict.
              </li>

              <li>
                In some cases, the final-year students/participants of the
                winning team pass out of college and proceed to higher studies
                or jobs, or some members of the team (due to some personal
                reasons) may not wish to continue with project development
                post-SIH, in such scenarios the respective teams have the
                flexibility to include new members into the team as
                replacements.{" "}

                If the IT/Domain expert from the ministry gets involved in the
                project quite seriously and turns out to be the major
                contributor (this can be determined after due consultation
                involving the respective team, the concerned
                ministry/department, and MIC/AICTE), then he/she can be

                Long Distance Travel: Each student is entitled to AC-III tier
                train ticket fare for long-distance travel. The amount will be

                relevant bills and receipts. If the bills/receipts are not
                produced, he/she won’t be reimbursed the said amount. Any
                distance within the radius of 100 Km will be considered a short
                distance. The central point of reference will be the
                individual’s college. If the student travels from any other
                location, the matter will be considered after satisfactory
